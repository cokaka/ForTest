System requirements（系统要求）
===================

This section describes the system requirements for this release.


Supported Linux operating systems（支持linux）
=================================

This section lists the supported operating system for this release of
Veritas products.

The Veritas Storage Foundation 5.1 SP1 PR2 release supports the following
operating system and hardware:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (RHEL 6) (2.6.32-71.el6 kernel) or later
  on AMD Opteron or Intel Xeon EM64T (x86_64)

Note: 64-bit operating systems are only supported.（仅支持64位）

If your system is running an older version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux,
you must upgrade it before attempting to install the Veritas software.
Consult the Red Hat documentation for more information on upgrading or
reinstalling your system.

Symantec supports only Red Hat distributed kernel binaries.


Symantec products operate on subsequent kernel and patch releases
provided the operating systems maintain kernel ABI (application binary
interface) compatibility.

Information about the latest supported Red Hat errata and updates is
available in the following TechNote:
http://entsupport.symantec.com/docs/335001

Read this TechNote before you install Symantec products.（安装前必读）

For information about the use of this product in a VMware Environment,
refer to http://entsupport.symantec.com/docs/289033


Performing preinstallation checks and configuration（安装前检查和配置）
===================================================

This document is designed for system administrators who already have a
basic knowledge of UNIX system and network administration. Basic
knowledge includes commands such as tar, mkdir, and simple shell
scripting. Also required is basic familiarity with the specific platform
and operating system where Storage Foundation is installed.
（此文档面向那些已有基本的UNIX以及网络知识的系统管理员。基本技能包括会使用tar、mkdir以及简单的shell脚本。同样也包括要熟悉安装SF所需的详细的平台和操作系统）

If you already have an earlier version of any of the Veritas products
installed, refer to the upgrade procedures.
（如果已经安装了旧版本，则进行升级）

Only users with superuser privileges can install and initialize Storage
Foundation.
（只有超级权限的用户才能安装和初始化SF）

Review the preinstallation requirements and system requirements. Install
the operating system before installing the Veritas software.
（重审安装前的要求，务必在安装VS前先安装好操作系统）

Mount the Veritas software disc, or download and uncompress the Storage
Foundation software.
（使用VS光盘，或者下载并解压VS）

To produce a report of the preinstallation requirements, run the
installer with the precheck option.
（产出安装前要求报告，执行安装脚本并选择提前检查选项）

# ./installer -precheck

If patches to the Linux operating system are required, the patches should
be applied prior to installing the Veritas products. Patches may be
required to resolve Linux kernel, product performance, or other issues.

The system should be in a quiescent state before adding patches.

See the product Release Notes for last minute information on recommended
patches.

For remote installation, or installation on multiple systems, set up
remsh or ssh.



Prechecking your systems using the Veritas installer
====================================================

The script-based and Web-based installer's precheck option checks for the
following:（这两个提前检查项会检查以下：）

* Recommended swap space for installation

* Recommended memory sizes on target systems for Veritas programs for
  best performance

* Required operating system versions


To use the precheck option

1. Start the script-based or Web-based installer.

2. Select the precheck option:

   * From the Web-based installer, select the Perform a
     Pre-Installation Check from the Task pull-down menu.

   * In the script-based installer, from root on the system where
     you want to perform the check, start the installer.

# ./installer

     In the Task Menu, press the p key to start the precheck.


3. Review the output and make the changes that the installer
   recommends.



About configuring secure shell or remote shell communication modes before
installing products（关于在安装前配置SSH或RSH）
=========================================================================

Establishing communication between nodes is required to install Veritas
software from a remote system, or to install and configure a cluster. The
node from which the installer is run must have permissions to run rsh
(remote shell) or ssh (secure shell) utilities. You need to run the
installer with superuser privileges on the systems where you plan to
install Veritas software.
（在两个节点建立可靠的通信是必须的。）

You can install products to remote systems using either secure shell
(ssh) or remote shell (rsh). Symantec recommends that you use ssh as it
is more secure than rsh.
（可以通过SSH或RSH来安装这个产品，Sym推荐使用SSH以为这样会更为安装）

This section contains an example of how to set up ssh password free
communication. The example sets up ssh between a source system (system1)
that contains the installation directories, and a target system
(system2). This procedure also applies to multiple target systems.
（设置SSH）


Configuring and enabling ssh
============================

The ssh program enables you to log into and execute commands on a remote
system. ssh enables encrypted communications and an authentication
process between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.
（可以保证登陆到另一台机器，并运行命令。）

In this procedure, you first create a DSA key pair. From the key pair,
you append the public key from the source system to the authorized_keys
file on the target systems.
（根据手册，首先创建一对DSA key）

Read the ssh documentation and online manual pages before enabling ssh.
Contact your operating system support provider for issues regarding ssh
configuration.
（）

Visit the OpenSSH website that is located at: http://openssh.org to
access online manuals and other resources.

To create the DSA key pair

1. On the source system (system1), log in as root, and navigate to the
   root directory.

system1 # cd /root

2. To generate a DSA key pair on the source system, type the following
   command:
   （创建DSAkey）

system1 # ssh-keygen -t dsa

   System output similar to the following is displayed:

Generating public/private dsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_dsa):

3. Press Enter to accept the default location of /root/.ssh/id_dsa.

4. When the program asks you to enter the passphrase, press the Enter
   key twice.

Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):

   Do not enter a passphrase. Press Enter.

Enter same passphrase again:

   Press Enter again.

5. Output similar to the following lines appears.

Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_dsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_dsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
1f:00:e0:c2:9b:4e:29:b4:0b:6e:08:f8:50:de:48:d2 root@system1


To append the public key from the source system to the authorized_keys
file on the target system, using secure file transfer

1. From the source system (system1), move the public key to a
   temporary file on the target system (system2).

   Use the secure file transfer program.

   In this example, the file name id_dsa.pub in the root directory is the
   name for the temporary file for the public key.

   Use the following command for secure file transfer:

system1 # sftp system2

   If the secure file transfer is set up for the first time on this
   system, output similar to the following lines is displayed:

Connecting to system2 ...
The authenticity of host 'system2 (10.182.00.00)' 
can't be established. DSA key fingerprint is
fb:6f:9f:61:91:9d:44:6b:87:86:ef:68:a6:fd:88:7d.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

2. Enter yes.

   Output similar to the following is displayed:

Warning: Permanently added 'system2,10.182.00.00' 
(DSA) to the list of known hosts.
root@system2 password:

3. Enter the root password of system2.

4. At the sftp prompt, type the following command:

sftp> put /root/.ssh/id_dsa.pub

   The following output is displayed:

Uploading /root/.ssh/id_dsa.pub to /root/id_dsa.pub

5. To quit the SFTP session, type the following command:

sftp> quit

6. Add the id_dsa.pub keys to the authorized_keys file on the target
   system. To begin the ssh session on the target system (system2 in this
   example), type the following command on system1:

system1 # ssh system2

   Enter the root password of system2 at the prompt:

password:

   Type the following commands on system2:

system2 # cat /root/id_dsa.pub >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
system2 # rm  /root/id_dsa.pub 

7. When you install from a source system that is also an installation
   target, also add the local system id_dsa.pub key to the local
   authorized_keys file. The installation can fail if the installation
   source system is not authenticated.

   To add the local system id_dsa.pub key to the local authorized_keys
   file, enter the following command:

system1 # cat /root/.ssh/id_dsa.pub >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

8. Run the following commands on the source installation system. If
   your ssh session has expired or terminated, you can also run these
   commands to renew the session. These commands bring the private key
   into the shell environment and make the key globally available to the
   user root:

system1 # exec /usr/bin/ssh-agent $SHELL
system1 # ssh-add

  Identity added: /root/.ssh/id_dsa

   This shell-specific step is valid only while the shell is active. You
   must execute the procedure again if you close the shell during the
   session.


To verify that you can connect to a target system

1. On the source system (system1), enter the following command:

system1 # ssh -l root system2 uname -a

   where system2 is the name of the target system.

2. The command should execute from the source system (system1) to the
   target system (system2) without the system requesting a passphrase or
   password.

3. Repeat this procedure for each target system.



Restarting the ssh session(重启ssh进程)
==========================

After you complete this procedure, ssh can be restarted in any of the
following scenarios:（根据以下程序，ssh可以在任何场景下重启）

* After a terminal session is closed（当远程进程关闭时）

* After a new terminal session is opened（当新建一个远程进程时）

* After a system is restarted（当系统重启时）

* After too much time has elapsed, to refresh ssh（当连接时间太长，刷新时）


To restart ssh

1. On the source installation system (system1), bring the private key
   into the shell environment.

system1 # exec /usr/bin/ssh-agent $SHELL

2. Make the key globally available for the user root

system1 # ssh-add



Enabling rsh for Linux（授权remote shell，远程shell）
======================

The following section describes how to enable remote shell.

Veritas recommends configuring a secure shell environment for Veritas
product installations.

See the operating system documentation for more information on
configuring remote shell.

To enable rsh

1. To ensure that the rsh and rsh-server packages are installed, type
   the following command:
--到这里--
# rpm -qa | grep -i rsh
（如果已经安装，将会显示rsh及rsh-server的版本）

   If it is not already in the file, type the following command to append
   the line "rsh" to the /etc/securetty file:

# echo "rsh" >> /etc/securetty

2. Modify /etc/init.d/rsh disable=no.

3. In the /etc/pam.d/rsh file, change the "auth" type from "required"
   to "sufficient":

auth     sufficient

4. Add the "promiscuous" flag into /etc/pam.d/rsh and
   /etc/pam.d/rlogin after item "pam_rhosts_auth.so".

5. To enable the rsh server, type the following command:

# chkconfig rsh on

6. Modify the .rhosts file. Each line of the .rhosts file contains a
   fully qualified domain name or IP address for each remote system. This
   file also contains the name of a user having access to the local
   system. For example, if the root user must remotely access system1
   from system2, add an entry for system2.companyname.com to the .rhosts
   file on system1 by typing the following command:

# echo "system2.companyname.com" >> $HOME/.rhosts

7. Install the Veritas product.


To disable rsh

1. Remove the "rsh" entry in the /etc/securetty file.

2. Disable the rsh server by typing the following command:

# chkconfig rsh off

3. After you complete an installation procedure, delete the .rhosts
   file from each user's $HOME directory to ensure security:

# rm -f $HOME/.rhosts

# Complete rsh setting

Downloading the Storage Foundation and High Availability software
=================================================================

One method of obtaining the Veritas Storage Foundation software is to
download it to your local system from the Symantec Web site.

For a Trialware download, you can use the following link. For other
downloads, contact your Veritas representative for more information.
http://www.symantec.com/business/products/downloads/index.jsp

If you download a standalone Veritas product, the single product download
files do not contain the product installer. Use the installation script
for the specific product to install the product.
（如果下载的是单一产品包，它将不会包括安装向导。你可以通过安装脚本来设置详细的安装。）

To download the software

1. Verify that you have enough space on your filesystem to store the
   downloaded software.
   （确保磁盘空间足够大）

   The estimated space for download, gunzip, and tar extract is 1 GB.
   （预估需要1G）

   If you plan to install the software on the same system, make sure that
   you also have enough space for the installed software.
   （如果你需要安装在当前目录，同样也要确保空间）

2. To see the space available, you can use the df command with the
   name of the local file system where you intend to download the
   software.

# df -k filesystem

   Note: When you select a location to download files, do not select a
   directory that contains Veritas products from a previous release or
   maintenance pack. Make sure that different versions exist in different
   directories.
   （请确保不同版本的软件存放在不同的目录下）

3. Download the software, specifying the file system with sufficient
   space for the file.



Storage Foundation prerequisites
================================

This section describes the Storage Foundation prerequisites.
（此部分描述SF预装条件）


Determining if the root disk is encapsulated
============================================

Check if the system's root disk is under VxVM control by running this
command:
（检查主磁盘是用VxVM来控制的）

# df -v /

The root disk is under VxVM control if /dev/vx/dsk/rootdg/rootvol is
listed as being mounted as the root (/) file system.

If the root disk is encapsulated, follow the appropriate upgrade
procedures.
（如果root disk是压缩的，通过下面的程序来进行适当的升级）


Planning the upgrade
====================

Be sure that the administrator doing the upgrade has root access and a
working knowledge of Linux operating system administration.
（确认管理员有足够的权限，而且需要一定linux操作系统的知识经验）

Complete the following tasks in advance of upgrading:
（在升级前需要完成以下的几个任务）

* Check the latest Storage Foundation Release Notes to verify that the
  system is running a supported Linux version.
  （检查当前版本是否与操作系统匹配）

* Schedule sufficient outage time for the upgrade, and downtime for any
  applications using the VxFS file systems or VxVM volumes.
  （计划好足够的存储时间，以及平台上运营的应用的停机）

* To reliably save information on a mirrored disk, shut down the system
  and physically remove the mirrored disk. (This may not be practical,
  but if done, offers a failback point.)
  （为保证可靠，最好将信息存放在镜像中，关机同时将镜像移走。这个未必是通过实践验证的，但如果已经做了，需要提供一个恢复的点）

* To upgrade on a remote host, rsh or ssh must be set up.
（如果是在远程机器进行升级，rsh或者ssh必须是已经安装好的）

* Determine if the root disk is encapsulated.
（确定root disk是压缩的）

* Select the method to upgrade.
（选择升级模式）



Saving system information before upgrade（升级前备份系统信息）
========================================

Use the following procedure to save system information before an upgrade.

To save system information before an upgrade

1. Log in as superuser.

2. Before upgrading, ensure that you have made backups of all data
   that you want to preserve.

3. In particular, you will need the information in files such as
   /boot/grub/menu.lst, /etc/grub.conf or /etc/lilo.conf (as
   appropriate), and /etc/fstab.

4. Copy fstab to fstab.orig:

# cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.orig

5. Run the vxlicrep, vxdisk list, and vxprint -ht commands and record
   the output. Use this information to reconfigure your system after the
   upgrade.

6. If you are installing the HA version of the Veritas Storage
   Foundation 5.1 SP1 PR2 software, follow the guidelines given in the
   Veritas Cluster Server Installation Guide and Veritas Cluster Server
   Release Notes for information on preserving your VCS configuration
   across the installation procedure.



Storage Foundation Cluster File System prerequisites
====================================================

This section describes the Storage Foundation Cluster File System
prerequisites.


Planning the upgrade
====================

Complete the following tasks in advance of upgrading:

* Review the Veritas Storage Foundation Release Notes for any
  late-breaking information on upgrading your system.

* Be sure that the administrator doing the upgrade has root access and
  a working knowledge of system administration.

* Schedule sufficient outage time for the upgrade.

* Make sure you have upgraded all the file systems to disk layout
  Version 6, before you upgrade SFCFS to 5.1 SP1 PR2. Disk layout Version
  7 is the recommended version for SFCFS 5.1 SP1 PR2.

  See vxupgrade(1M), vxconvert(1M), and fsadm(1M) manual pages.

  See the Veritas File System Administrator's Guide.

* Verify all the file systems are working fine and data is intact.

  See the cfsmount(1M) manual page.



Preparing the system and backing up files before upgrading
==========================================================

Before upgrading an installed Veritas Storage Foundation Cluster File
System, preserve the existing configuration information.

To preserve the existing configuration information, perform the following
actions:

* Make a record of the mount points for VxFS file systems and VxVM
  volumes that are defined in the /etc/fstab file. You will need to
  recreate these entries in the /etc/fstab file on the freshly installed
  system.

* Before upgrading, ensure that you have made backups of all data that
  you want to preserve. In particular, you will need the information in
  files such as /boot/grub/menu.lst, /etc/grub.conf, /etc/elilo.conf, or
  /etc/lilo.conf (as appropriate), and /etc/fstab. You should also run
  the vxlicrep, vxdisk list, and vxprint -ht commands, and record the
  output from these. You may need this information to reconfigure your
  system after the upgrade.

* Use the vxlicrep command to make a record of the currently installed
  Veritas licenses.

* Back up the configuration files.

# cp -r /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/ backupdirectory/

* If Veritas Volume Replicator (VVR) is configured, do the following
  steps in the order shown:

  - Make sure that the disk groups that contain RVGs are at least at
    disk group version 110.

# vxdg list diskgroup

  - Make sure the size of the SRL volume is greater than 110 MB.

    Refer to the Veritas Volume Replicator Administrator's Guide.

  - Stop all the applications involved in replication. For example,
    if a data volume contains a file system, unmount it.

  - Verify that all of the Primary RLINKs are up to date:

# vxrlink -g diskgroup status rlink_name

  Note: Do not continue until the Primary RLINKs are up to date.



About the Web-based installer（关于基于Web的安装）
=============================
#选择这种模式，会提供一个URL，可以通过该URL，在可视化页面进行操作

Use the Web-based installer's interface to install Veritas products. The
Web-based installer can perform most of the tasks that the script-based
installer performs.

You use the webinstaller script to start and stop the Veritas XPortal
Server xprtlwid process. The webinstaller script can also be used to
check the status of the XPortal Server.

When the webinstaller script starts the xprtlwid process, the script
displays a URL. Use this URL to access the Web-based installer from a Web
browser such as Internet Explorer or FireFox.

The Web installer creates log files whenever the Web installer is
operating. While the installation processes are operating, the log files
are located in a session-based directory under the /var/tmp directory.
After the install process completes, the log files are located in the
/opt/VRTS/install/logs directory. It is recommended that you keep the
files for auditing, debugging, and future use.

The location of the Veritas XPortal Server configuration file is
/var/opt/webinstaller/xprtlwid.conf.


About installation scripts
==========================
#提供一下几种安装的脚本

Veritas Storage Foundation and High Availability Solutions 5.1 SP1 PR2
provides several installation scripts.

An alternative to the installer script is to use a product-specific
installation script. If you obtained a Veritas product from an electronic
download site, which does not include the installer, use the appropriate
product installation script.

The following product installation scripts are available:

Veritas Cluster Server (VCS)
 installvcs

Veritas Storage Foundation (SF)
 installsf

Veritas Storage Foundation and High Availability (SFHA)
 installsfha

Veritas Storage Foundation Cluster File System (SFCFS)
 installsfcfs

Veritas Storage Foundation Cluster File System for Oracle RAC (SFCFSRAC)
 installsfcfsrac

Veritas Storage Foundation for Oracle RAC (SF Oracle RAC)
 installsfrac

Symantec Product Authentication Service (AT)
 installat

Veritas Dynamic Multi-pathing
 installdmp

Symantec VirtualStore
 installsvs


To use the installation script, enter the script name at the prompt. For
example, to install Veritas Storage Foundation, type ./installsf at the
prompt.



Starting and stopping processes for the Veritas products
========================================================

After the installation and configuration is complete, the Veritas product
installer starts the processes that are used by the installed products.
You can use the product installer to stop or start the processes, if
required.

To stop the processes

* Use the -stop option to stop the product installation script.

  For example, to stop the product's processes, enter the following
  command:

# ./installer -stop


To start the processes

* Use the -start option to start the product installation script.

  For example, to start the product's processes, enter the following
  command:

# ./installer -start



Restarting the installer after a failed connection（连接失败后可以重新继续进行安装）
==================================================

If an installation is killed because of a failed connection, you can
restart the installer to resume the installation. The installer detects
the existing installation. The installer prompts you whether you want to
resume the installation. If you resume the installation, the installation
proceeds from the point where the installation failed.



Installation program has improved failure handling
==================================================

The product installer has improved ability to recover from failed
installations, as follows:

* A recovery file is created if an installation fails due to a failed
  network connection. This file enables the install program to resume
  from the point where the installation failed.

* New options are available to start or stop the Veritas processes
  without requiring a full installation or configuration.



About the Veritas installer
===========================

The installer also enables you to configure the product, verify
preinstallation requirements, and view the product's description.

If you obtained a standalone Veritas product from an electronic download
site, the single product download files do not contain the general
product installer. Use the product installation script to install the
product.

At most points during the installation you can type the following
characters for different actions:

* Use b (back) to return to a previous section of the installation
  procedure. The back feature of the installation scripts is
  context-sensitive, so it returns to the beginning of a grouped section
  of questions.

* Use Control - c to stop and exit the program if an installation
  procedure hangs. After a short delay, the script exits.

* Use q to quit the installer.

* Use ? to display help information.

* Use the Enter button to accept a default response.


Additional options are available for the installer.



Troubleshooting the webinstaller
================================

This section provides possible solutions to problems that may occur when
using the webinstaller.

Issue: The webinstaller script may report an error.

You may receive a similar error message when using the webinstaller:

Error: could not get hostname and IP address

Solution: Check whether /etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf file are
correctly configured.

Issue: The hostname is not a fully qualified domain name.
